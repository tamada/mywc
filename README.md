# mywc

This project is an implementation of the simplest `wc` command in use of `wildcat` as an API.
Please see `goMain` function in `main.go` the details of how to count the words and etc.

Unfortunately, the API of `wildcat` was not refined well.
Moreover, the API document of `wildcat` was not written well.
I will try to resolve above problems about a month (2022-08-31).
